QUESTION 3
# Result: prompt7_response , gpt4 , temp = 0.7
# Question 1:




# - **Topics**: Multithreading, Concurrency, Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
# - **Scenario**: A python programmer in a large tech company is working on a script that needs to download several files
# concurrently to optimize time. He decided to use Python threading module.
# - **Code**:
# ```python
import threading
import urllib.request




def download_file(url, file_name):
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    data = response.read()
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(data)




urls = [
    'http://example.com/file1.txt',
    'http://example.com/file2.txt',
    'http://example.com/file3.txt'
]




for i, url in enumerate(urls):
    threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=(url, f'file{i}.txt')).start()
```
# - **Question**: The code has an efficiency issue due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
# The code is not as fast as expected. What can be done to improve this?
# - **Explanation**: The GIL is a mechanism in CPython that only allows one thread to execute Python bytecodes
#  at a time in a single process. Threading in Python does not take advantage of multiple cores because of the GIL.
# A better alternative for I/O bound tasks like downloading files from the internet would be to use asynchronous I/O
# or multiprocessing.
# - **Answer**:
# ```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import urllib.request




def download_file(url, file_name):
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    data = response.read()
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(data)




urls = [
    'http://example.com/file1.txt',
    'http://example.com/file2.txt',
    'http://example.com/file3.txt'
]




with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for i, url in enumerate(urls):
        executor.submit(download_file, url, f'file{i}.txt')
```
