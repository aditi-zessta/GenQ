# GenQ
Welcome to the GenQ repository! This repository contains a curated collection of questions generated with the help of GPT models, prompt engineering, and various online resources. Our goal is to go beyond traditional data structures and algorithms to create a comprehensive question bank for our product, ZeCode.

About the Repository
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This collection includes questions generated by GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini models and some from our knowledge and the resources we consulted. We have refined and tweaked these questions to ensure originality and relevance. Our approach involves combining insights from multiple sources and leveraging prompt engineering techniques to create high-quality questions. While the accuracy of the questions and answers is not yet perfect, we are committed to achieving 100% accuracy through continuous iterations and reviews.

Resources Consulted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have consulted a variety of resources to enhance the quality and diversity of our questions, including:

Andrew Ng's course on ChatGPT and prompt engineering: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Develope

Various FAANG+ interview resources

We welcome contributions and feedback to help improve the quality and accuracy of our question bank.
